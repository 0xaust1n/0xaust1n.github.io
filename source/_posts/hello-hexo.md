## Intro  
Sup, This is Austin. Welcome to my blog.  
At the first start. I was using `Docusaurus` to build my blog.  
I tried to do a lot of coding to make the blog more beautiful.  
I am so done with the `CSS` .

Since I'm not the Front-end engineer anymore.  
~~Absolutely no because I'm not dominating the CSS~~  
I will spend more time improving my back-end skill.  

## Purpose
- Trynna improve my English writing skill.  
> I didn't pass the exam because my grammar is totally mess.  
> I even didn't understand what it is nowadays.  
- Recording my knowledge.  
> All the human are forgetful  
- Sharing my research?  
> Teaching is the only way to master what you had learned.  
> According to `Cone of Learning`  


## Disclaimer
- The words that I use won't be too formal.  
> My Blog, My Rules, My Coffee  
- Broken Grammar Still.  
- Random Update  

Anyway. Be my guest.  
I got nothing to hide :P  
Enjoy.  
All the best,  
Austin
